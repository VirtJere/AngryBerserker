# Plot
The Viking (name selectable) wants to marry his love, but she gets possessed by demons, which pisses him off a lot. He goes to wizard to ask what is he supposed to do. The wizard tells him that to save his love, the Viking needs to go far north for the ancient relic (whatever it is) and gives him the map of Finland.The relic parts are located in various areas.

The Viking is determined to save his love who got cursed by evil spirit. He goes according to the map. There is not much ambiguity where to go. So in the end of each levels Viking gets part of relic and fights enemies: trolls and ogres. He gets to the north and has to fight Joulupukki to get the heart of the relic from him. The Joulupukki dies and the portal is opened to go back to his village.

He gets to the village , does something with the relic, the bride gets back to normal, and finally he fights the demon banished from her.

# Levels
1. The village at around Lahti. The viking goes to his bride's house and learns some bullshit story of how she got possessed. The bride's father sends him to the wizard. On the way there is tutorial how to fight enemies and any other nice hints are given. The viking goes to wizard. Wizard start explaining some bullshit and suddenly the bad guys attack. Wizard tells viking to eat a specific mushroom. Viking eats it and becomes a killing machine for a short time. It is final part of tutorial about the coolest power-up. Then he finally explains the bullshit about the bride possession. The wizard by magic sends the viking to the next level.

2. Second level - Teräsbetoni area. The area looks like some weird bunker (steel and concrete, huh). Steel spikes everywhere, so kinda dangerous. Enemies on the level: robot-like creatures, easy to kill, trolls that are a bit harder to kill. In the end there can be a boss - bigger robot. 

3. Third level - Yö. The night level in the forest (surprise, daa). The level goes from sunset to the morning, and since our viking is powerful and doesn't need any sleep, he keeps going. However, crazy squirrels are craving for his blood, so he should either avoid them or kill them. There's also some wild dogs (or maybe wolves) walking around. Final boss is Batman. Maybe. Because reasons.

4. Fourth level - Nightwish. The night level around the lake, very beautiful, but from midnight to the sunrise. Because it's dangerous to sleep when crazy priests are trying to convince you to believe in Jesus and they don't go to hell if you don't make them to. By killing, of course. So viking continues his brave journey, fighting priests and ogres who throw stones at him.

5. Fifth level - Sonata Arctica. Here the trees are lifeless, the first snow appears, the rare cloudberry bushes, everything is sad, depressing and there's lots of swamps, which viking should avoid (if not yet depressed enough to kill yourself). Swamp trolls are insulting him all the way.

6. Sixth level - Lordi. One big ice slope, full of icy spikes, holes in the ground and crazy reindeers trying to kick viking's tough ass. Small ramps give some fun and help to avoid some obstacles (or not). In the end viking needs to fight Joulupukki, who is cruel and psychotic, so the chance of survival is pretty low. But since viking is madly in love, he goes for it to get the final part of the relic. When Joulupukki dies, he sends viking to HELL-Sinki by his magic.

7. And the final level - viking is in hell (or Helsinki, no one knows). He got all parts of the relic, it is complete now and viking fights the evil spirit who claimed to possess his bride. After the spirit is defeated, the portal gets viking to the village, where it all started, and the bride, is happy, everyone's happy, viking marries her, the end.
